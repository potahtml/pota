# Test Plan

Track what has tests and what still needs them. Work one section at a
time. Write 1 file at a time.

---

## Notes

- All test files should import helpers from `#test` (aliased to
  `pota/use/test`).
- Tests run in a real Chromium browser (Puppeteer, headed by default).
  DOM APIs are available; `body()` from `pota/use/test` returns
  `document.body.innerHTML`.
- The test harness (`tools/test-runner/test.js`) clears `document.body`,
  `document.head`, and `document.adoptedStyleSheets` before each test,
  and verifies all three are clean after each test. A test that leaves
  DOM behind will fail.
- When using `render`, call the returned `dispose` function at the end
  of the test — the harness asserts the document is empty afterward to
  verify proper node cleanup.
- Use JSX directly in test files (they are transformed) — no
  `Component()` calls needed.
- Make sure tests cover every situation possible.
- Before writing each file, think if you would do something better
  and do it.

## Agent Notes

- Prefer one-file ownership. Finish reading source, editing, and
  tightening assertions for one file before moving to the next.
- Before marking a row as done, verify the file actually exists in
  `tests/` and the row points to the real path.
- Prefer exact output assertions (`toBe('...')`) when the output is
  stable enough. Use narrower DOM assertions only when browser
  serialization is likely to vary.
- Do not introduce helper mini-frameworks inside test files. Inline
  the setup unless a tiny helper is clearly unavoidable.
- If a test file covers framework invariants or internal utilities
  rather than package exports, keep it listed in a dedicated section
  instead of pretending it maps 1:1 to public exports.

## Rules For Fixing Tests

- Do not cheat the tests. The goal is to verify real behavior, not to
  make failures disappear.
- Do not use `try` / `catch` or `try` / `finally` in test bodies to
  hide assertion failures or force cleanup after a broken expectation.
- Keep the essence of the original test intact. If a test is being
  corrected, preserve the original scenario and intention unless the
  source code proves that the scenario itself is invalid.
- Do not rewrite a clear, intentional test into a narrower or
  different scenario just because the current implementation is buggy.
  A failing test may be exposing a real framework bug. Report that
  distinction clearly before changing the test.
- Only change a test when there is a strong reason to believe the test
  is flawed. Prefer reading the implementation first and adjusting the
  expectation to match real behavior.
- Do not weaken a test just to make it pass. Avoid replacing a strong
  assertion with a vague one unless browser serialization or platform
  behavior genuinely makes the stronger assertion unreliable.
- If you cannot confidently fix a failing test, leave the test logic
  as close as possible to the original and add a short comment inside
  the body of that specific test function explaining what seems
  unclear, surprising, or framework-dependent.
- Comments added for this purpose should be factual and specific. They
  should explain what is uncertain and why the test was left as-is.

## Timing Considerations

See `documentation/scheduler.md` § "Timing for tests" for the full
rule of thumb. Quick reminders specific to writing tests:

- Prefer `microtask` over `macrotask`, and `macrotask` over `sleep`.
- Do not use double `await microtask()` — use a single `await
  macrotask()` instead.
- `useTimeout` tests need `sleep > timer delay`.

## Current Gaps

- Main remaining behavioral gap is `babel-preset` tooling coverage
  beyond the 12-check smoke test in `tools/babel-preset/test/`.
- `map()` direct fallback usage (without `For`) is commented out —
  the fallback cleanup mechanism doesn't work outside `For`.

All test file paths below are relative to `tests/api/` unless noted.

## Layout at a glance

```
tests/
  api/                      browser tests, discovered by the runner
    components/             one file per built-in component
    reactivity/             one file per reactive primitive
    dom/                    renderer, refs, props, events
    forms/                  native HTML form behavior
    jsx/                    JSX transform + tracking semantics
    store/                  one file per `pota/store` export
    use/                    one file per `pota/use/*` module
    console-formatting.jsx  test-runner capture pipeline
    std.jsx                 selected `src/lib/std.js` utilities
    xml.jsx                 `pota/xml` tagged-template renderer
  typescript/               typecheck-only (.tsx), run via `npm run test:ts-tests`
```

The Puppeteer runner discovers everything under `tests/api/` that
matches `.jsx`/`.tsx`/`.ts` (except `.d.ts`). No registration step.
